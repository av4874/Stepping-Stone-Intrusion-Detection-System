# Stepping-Stone-Intrusion-Detection-System
By Amatullah Vakhariya and Mahrukh Sania


Cybercriminals often use stepping stone attacks to conceal their identity and behavior while conducting their activities. In a stepping stone intrusion, the attacker uses a chain of hosts known as relay hosts to remotely log into the victim machine.  Since each interactive TCP session will be separate from other sessions between the client and the server, it would be challenging to determine where the attack originated because the attacker would have gained access to the victim's computer through numerous relayed sessions. In this project, we build a chain of hosts to relay messages using SSH, netcat (raw TCP), and the HTTP protocol. We collect and examine an extensive dataset that would be generated through the tunnels to better understand the properties of the attack. In this way, we contribute to the development of new techniques for identifying cybercriminals and stepping stone attacks.
